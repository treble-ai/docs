## Attach Multimedia - Multimedia Variable

In the Treble editor, you can attach multimedia to your messages. This will allow you to add images, videos, audio, and file attachments and send them dynamically in your conversations.

Normally, you do it as follows:

1. Go to the conversation node where you want to attach the multimedia.
2. Select the type of multimedia you want to attach.
3. Select the file you want to attach.
4. Click on **Attach**.

<img src="/images/media-2.png" alt="Attach multimedia in the Treble editor" />

Now, let's see how you can make the multimedia content not a static content, but a dynamic one. For this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the conversation node where you want to attach the multimedia.
2. Click on the **Attach <Icon icon="paperclip" iconType="solid" />** button.
3. Choose the **Variable** option.
4. This will open a modal where you can define the name of the variable. In our example, we will call it `media_url`. This variable is a `user_session_key`.

<img src="/images/media-4.gif" alt="Attach multimedia in the Treble editor" />

5. Done! Now, this variable (in our case `media_url`) will wait for the URL of the image, video, audio, or file attachment that you want to attach.

<Note>
    The URL of the image, video, audio, or file attachment must be a public URL. To check if it's a public URL, you can open it in your browser. If you can see the content, then it's a public URL.
</Note>

## How is this variable handled?

You have the following options to handle this variable:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Option 1: CSV deployment of your conversation flow">
        In this case, when you upload a CSV file, the content of the `media_url` column should be the URL of the image, video, audio, or file attachment that you want to attach. This will allow you to send a customized file URL for each user.

        For example:
        | country\_code | cellphone  | name   | media\_url |
        | ------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
        | 57            | 3132392346 | Felipe | https://example.com/image.jpg |
        | 34            | 622902416  | Camila | https://example.com/video.mp4 |

    <Step title="Option 2: API deployment">
        In this case, when you make a call to the Treble API, you must send the content of the `media_url` variable in the call body. This variable will be part of the `user_session_keys` that are sent in the call.

        For example:

        ```json
        {   
            [...],
            "user_session_keys": [
                {
                    "key": "media_url",
                    "value": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Option 3: In a webhook response">
        In this case, when you make a call to a webhook, and before reaching the conversation node with the node that has the `media_url` variable, you can call a webhook, and in the response of this webhook, you can send the URL of the image, video, audio, or file attachment that you want to attach.

        >
            You can add the URL of the image, video, audio, or file attachment in a webhook response through the `user_session_keys`.
