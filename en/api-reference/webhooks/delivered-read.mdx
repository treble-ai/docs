## How does it work?

Through Treble, which uses WhatsApp Business API, when a user reads or receives a message, we can configure a webhook to be triggered when this happens.

### Example use case

Let's say you're a clothing sales company and you want to know when a customer has read or received your first marketing message about a promotion for your new clothing collection. You'll offer a 10% discount on their first purchase to the first 100 customers who subscribe to your newsletter.

For this, you can configure a message read webhook in Treble. When a customer reads or receives your message, the webhook will be triggered and will send an HTTP request to your endpoint configured in Treble.

## How to configure a message delivery or read webhook?

<Steps>
    <Step title="Log in to Treble.ai">
        Log in to Treble.ai through the following URL: <a class="article-link" href="https://app.treble.ai"><p>https://app.treble.ai</p><Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" /></a>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a flow">
        Go to the "Conversations" section and click on the **"Create Conversation"** button. You can also configure a message read webhook in an existing flow. For this, go to the "Flows" section and click on the **"Edit" <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" />** button of your flow.

        <img src="/images/create-convo.gif" alt="Create Conversation" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add message blocks">
        Let's add the first message block. Click on the **"Add block" <Icon icon="plus" iconType="solid" />** button. In this case, we will add a message template (HSM) previously created and approved by Meta. Then we will connect a simple message block with the HSM block.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate webhook and add endpoint">
        Now, let's double-click on the message block, a panel will open on the left. In this panel, let's click on the **"Webhook" <Icon icon="toggle-on" iconType="solid" />** button. Two fields will appear:

        - **"Read"**: Here you can add the endpoint to which you want the HTTP request to be sent when this message is read.
        - **"Delivered"**: Here you can add the endpoint to which you want the HTTP request to be sent when this message is received.

        <img src="/images/webhook-rd-3.gif" alt="Add a message block" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save changes">
        If you are in a new flow, click on the **"Publish Conversation"** button to save the flow. If you are in an existing flow, click on the **"Save"** button to save the changes.

        <Check>
            Done! Now, when a customer reads or receives your message, the webhook will be triggered and will send an HTTP request to your endpoint configured in Treble.
        </Check>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Next step

To know the body of the HTTP request that is sent when a customer reads or receives a message, you can visit the following section:

<CardGroup columns={2}>
    <Card 
        title="Message Delivery Webhook Request Body" 
        icon="code"
        href="/en/api-reference/webhooks/delivered-api"
    >
        Message Delivery Webhook Request Body
    </Card>
    <Card 
        title="Message Read Webhook Request Body" 
        icon="code"
        href="/en/api-reference/webhooks/read-api"
    >
        Message Read Webhook Request Body
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips 

- Keep in mind that the message delivery and read webhooks are triggered when a customer reads or receives a message and only apply to the message you configured. If you want it to be triggered on other messages, you must configure a webhook for each message.
- The message read webhook may not be triggered if the WhatsApp user has read privacy mode configured.
