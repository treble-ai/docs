## What are HSM templates?

HSM (Highly Structured Messages) templates are predefined messages that are used in WhatsApp Business API conversations.

## Why does Meta require HSM templates?

Meta implements HSM templates as a protection measure for WhatsApp users. This system helps to:

- Prevent spam and unwanted messages
- Ensure that business messages are relevant and expected
- Maintain the quality of business communication
- Protect user privacy

Templates must be approved by Meta before they can be used, which ensures they comply with policies and quality standards.

## 24-hour messaging window

When a user interacts with a business message on WhatsApp, a 24-hour "messaging window" opens. During this period:

1. The business can send messages without using HSM templates
2. More fluid and natural communication is allowed
3. Any type of content allowed by WhatsApp can be sent

Once the 24-hour window expires, the business must use an approved HSM template to initiate a new conversation.

## HSM template categories

Meta classifies templates into four main categories:

### 1. Marketing

- Promotions and offers
- Product launches
- Newsletters
- Brand updates
- Event invitations

**Note**: Marketing templates have stricter approval requirements and must provide a clear opt-out option.

### 2. Service

- Order confirmations
- Shipping updates
- Appointment reminders
- Customer service notifications
- Account status updates

### 3. Authentication

- Verification codes
- Login confirmations
- Password reset
- Two-step verification
- Security codes

### 4. Utility

- Registration confirmations
- Account updates
- System notifications
- Important alerts
- Billing information

Each category has its own guidelines and approval times. For example:
- Authentication templates are usually approved more quickly
- Marketing templates require more review time
- Service and utility templates have an intermediate approval process

## Customize HSM templates with variables

You can customize HSM templates with variables. Variables are dynamic information that you can use in your HSM templates. For example, you can use variables to personalize a customer's welcome message, or to send a customer's name in a message.

To create a variable, you just need to write the variable name in the template content. For example, if you want to send a customer's name in a message, you can write `{{customer_name}}`.

<Note>It is important to understand the structure of variables. We recommend that the variable name be a clear and descriptive name that does not contain special characters or spaces. The variable must be enclosed in double braces `{{}}`. Additionally, we recommend that the variable be in lowercase and not contain spaces.</Note>

### Example of using variables

<img src="/images/sample-vars.png" />

As you can see in the example, the `{{name}}` variable is replaced by the customer's name in the message and the `{{company}}` variable is replaced by the company name in the message.

Treble recognizes the variables you use in your HSM templates and allows you to use them in your conversational flows. When you are going to send a conversation, you can specify the value of the variables for each user you want to send the conversation to.

## Approval status of HSM templates

You can see the approval status of your HSM templates in the **HSM Templates** section in Treble. When you first create a template, its status will be "Pending".

Once Meta approves the template, its status will change to "Approved".

<img src="/images/hsm-state-approved.png" />

We recommend that you always check the approval status of your HSM templates before using them in your conversational flows. Since Meta's approval time can vary, it is important that you always keep an eye on this status, you just need to refresh the page to see the updated status.

From this view you can also see the approval status of each template. There are different approval statuses:

- **Approved** ðŸŸ¢: The template has been approved by Meta. The template can be used in your conversational flows.
- **Pending** ðŸŸ¡: The template is in the approval process.
- **Rejected** ðŸ”´: The template has been rejected by Meta. The template can be rejected for different reasons, such as inappropriate content, lack of clarity in the opt-out option, or non-compliance with WhatsApp policies.

## Edit HSM templates

You can edit an HSM template in the **HSM Templates** section in Treble. To do this, click on the **"Edit"** button <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> on the template you want to edit.
