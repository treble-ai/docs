## Introduction

Message templates in the WhatsApp Business API have different categories, and pricing varies according to classification. **Marketing** messages are more expensive than **utility** messages, so it's essential to optimize wording to ensure templates are approved as **utility**. According to Meta, utility messages must be linked to previous user interactions and have a transactional character.

This guide provides strategies, keywords, and examples for structuring messages that meet these criteria, reducing costs without compromising communication with customers.

## General Guidelines for Utility Classification

1. **Based on a previous user action:**
    - Reference a past event, such as a purchase, scheduled appointment, or support request.
    - Avoid generic or promotional messages without previous context.
2. **Maintain an informative and transactional tone:**
    - Prioritize the purpose of updates, notifications, or follow-ups.
    - Avoid messages with a strong commercial or persuasive focus.
3. **Avoid promotional terms and direct offers:**
    - Words like "discount", "promotion", "special offer" or "win" indicate marketing.
    - Opt for neutral expressions like "follow-up", "update" and "continuation".
4. **Use questions to encourage interaction:**
    - Instead of buttons, end the message with an open question to generate interaction without seeming like a promotional campaign.

## Ideal Structure of a Utility Message

- **Contextualized opening:** Reference to the user's previous action.
- **Relevant information:** Objective explanation about the status of the action.
- **Subtle call to action:** Invitation to continue with the process without a promotional tone.

### Practical Examples

### 1. Lead Re-engagement

**Marketing (more expensive):**
"We have a special offer for you! Get 10% off your next purchase. Access the link and take advantage of it."

**Utility (cheaper):**
"Hello! We noticed you recently completed our form. Can we help you continue with your request?"

### 2. Abandoned Cart

**Marketing (more expensive):**
"Your cart is still waiting for you! Complete your purchase now and get free shipping."

**Utility (cheaper):**
"We noticed your purchase attempt wasn't completed. If you need help finalizing your order, we're at your disposal."

### 3. Post-sale and Recommendations

**Marketing (more expensive):**
"Did you like your last purchase? Discover our related products and take advantage of exclusive discounts."

**Utility (cheaper):**
"Based on your last purchase, we can recommend a complementary product. Would you like more details?"

### 4. Reminders and Appointments

**Marketing (more expensive):**
"Don't miss it! Last spots for our special event. Register now and secure your place."

**Utility (cheaper):**
"We remind you that you have an event scheduled for [date]. If you need more information, we're here to help."
