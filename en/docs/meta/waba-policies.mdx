### WhatsApp Business and Commercial Policies

Meta monitors WhatsApp Business accounts that repeatedly violate Business and Commercial policies.

WhatsApp's commercial policy is used to determine if a business can sell its products and services using WhatsApp's commercial features: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/.

The WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy determines the acceptable use of WhatsApp Business Products in general: https://business.whatsapp.com/policy

- Prohibitions
    - Illegal, fraudulent, or misleading content
    - Violation of intellectual property rights
    - Discrimination or hate speech
    - Harassment or bullying

    - Sale of regulated products and services
    - Sexual or adult content
    - Gambling and betting
- Requirements
    - Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
    - Protection of user privacy and data
    - Transparency in business practices

It is important for businesses to be aware of these policies and follow them rigorously to maintain access to the WhatsApp Business Platform. Otherwise, the consequences of violations are:

- Warnings and temporary restrictions for minor violations
- Suspension or account closure for serious or repeated violations
- Possible permanent blocking from using the platform

### Notices and notifications

### Consequences

Initially, they will receive a warning with information about the policy that was violated. If the account repeatedly violates high-risk policy categories (adult content, sale of alcohol and tobacco, drugs, gambling, and unsafe supplements) of our Commerce Policy, some actions may occur, including:

- **1 or 3-day block on sending** business-initiated messages and adding other phone numbers to the account.
- **5 or 7-day block on sending business-initiated messages and responding** to customer-initiated messages, as well as adding other phone numbers to the account.
- Indefinite account block on opening conversations, which can only be removed by appeal

‚ö†Ô∏è If the business does not make improvements after several warnings and feature limitations, **the account may be permanently deactivated on the WhatsApp Business Platform**. They may also limit or remove the business from WhatsApp if their account receives a high volume of negative user feedback.

### View violation details and appeal

In case a business is notified, violation details can be viewed and an appeal can be made - it is possible to appeal all policy violations within a 90-day period.

By following these tips, businesses can minimize the risk of violations and maintain a positive presence on the WhatsApp Business Platform, avoiding account restrictions or suspensions.

### WhatsApp Business Number Quality Rating

The quality rating of WhatsApp Business numbers is based on recent messages your customers received in the last seven days.

It depends on feedback and opinions from your customers, such as the **reasons for blocking your phone number** and other error reports. When users block your business, they can select a reason, such as:

- **I no longer need it**
- **I didn't subscribe**
- **Spam**
- **Offensive messages**
- **No reason**.

You can find your quality rating in the **Phone numbers** tab of Meta's WhatsApp Manager. The **Quality rating** column shows quality levels, which include:

- **Green:** high quality
    
    If your business maintains a **High** quality rating, it will be able to meet the requirements to use more features.
    
- **Yellow:** medium quality
- **Red:** low quality
    
    If your quality rating is medium or low, you can hover over it in the WhatsApp Manager to check more information about the blocking reasons, if available
    

üîî You will receive an email and a notification in Meta Business Manager when the following situations occur:

- A phone number's status is changed to **Flagged** or the **Flagged** status is removed.
- There is a change in the message limits of a phone number.

You can click on the icon located in the Settings column to check the quality rating for the last 30 days. You can see the lowest quality score that the business receives on a given day, which will allow you to better understand the potential factors driving the drop or increase in quality rating over the last 30 days.

### Status Change and Message Limits in WhatsApp Business

Status change and message limits are measures implemented by WhatsApp Business to ensure the quality of interactions between businesses and customers.

- Message limits
    
    Message limits determine the maximum number of business-initiated conversations that each phone number can initiate in a rolling 24-hour period. There are four levels of limits:
    
    - 1,000 business-initiated conversations per phone number in 24 hours
    - 10,000 business-initiated conversations per phone number in 24 hours
    - 100,000 business-initiated conversations per phone number in 24 hours
    - Unlimited number of business-initiated conversations in 24 hours
    
    <img src="/images/waba-policies-6.png" alt="Message limits" />
    

**Status change:** Refers to the change in the status of a conversation between a business and a customer. These are the meanings of each status:

- **Connected:** can send outgoing messages within the message limit set for you.
- **Flagged:** this status is activated when the phone number's quality rating changes to "Low" and is on its way to descending to a lower message level. Businesses cannot update message limit levels if their status is "Flagged". If the quality rating:
    - **Improves to high or medium quality within seven days** from when the status changed to Flagged, it will return to Connected and **your message limit level will not be affected.**
    - **Does not improve to high or medium quality within seven days** from when the status changed to Flagged, it will return to Connected. However, **your message limit will decrease to the next level.**
- **Restricted:** this status is activated when you reach your message limit, regardless of your quality rating. While the status is Restricted, you will not be able to send outgoing messages until 24 hours have passed, but you can continue responding to customer-initiated messages.
