**What features does the Chrome extension offer?**

- The Chrome extension allows you to view tasks assigned to the user in HubSpot and if it's a new contact, you can create it in HubSpot from the extension.

**Is it mandatory to install the Chrome extension to use Trebot?**

- No, the Chrome extension is completely optional and independent, so it doesn't affect the synchronization in any way. You can use the main functionality of synchronizing WhatsApp to HubSpot without the extension, but you'll miss out on some advanced features only available through the extension.

**Does the Chrome extension affect my browser performance?**

- The Chrome extension is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with minimal impact on your browser's performance. It has been optimized to work in the background without slowing down your browsing experience.
