**What should I do if I've already reached the device limit connected to WhatsApp?**

- If you want to use Trebot AutoSync, but you've already reached the limit of devices connected to your WhatsApp, you'll need to choose a device to disconnect in order to add Trebot. The synchronization depends on keeping Trebot as a connected device.

**How can I view follow-up tasks using Trebot AutoSync?**

- If you've created tasks within HubSpot, Trebot will send you a reminder, and if you use the Chrome extension, you'll be able to see it in the right panel.

**What happens if I uninstall the Chrome extension?**

- You can simply go to your WhatsApp from your phone and in settings go to connected devices and disconnect Trebot. Then Trebot will ask you to reconnect and gives you the option to continue from your computer or phone. Select computer and open WhatsApp Web, you'll have the steps again to have the Chrome extension installation. Be careful: don't search for the extension on Google, only if you follow the Trebot flow will it be able to connect you with your user.

**Are WhatsApp chats synchronized in HubSpot even from an unknown number?**

- If you use Trebot AutoPilot, all chats are synchronized at the end of the day. If a contact doesn't have a visible name on WhatsApp, it will appear as "Trebot Contact" in HubSpot. This is independent of the name saved in your address book.

**How does Trebot protect my data and conversations?**

- Trebot offers end-to-end conversation synchronization, selective synchronization control, data privacy compliance, a secure authentication process, and a secure browser extension.

**Are my WhatsApp or HubSpot credentials stored?**

- No, Trebot uses secure authentication methods that don't require storing your credentials. The connection process is carried out through secure channels authorized by WhatsApp and HubSpot.

**Are there any hidden costs or premium features?**

- No, Trebot is completely free, with no hidden costs or "premium" features. All features are included in the free version.

**What can I do if I still have questions or if Trebot stops working?**
